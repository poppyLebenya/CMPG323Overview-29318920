## Branching Strategy
https://github.com/poppyLebenya/CMPG323Overview-29318920/blob/main/GitFlow.PNG

With my branching stategy, I plan to have my main branch, development branch, release branch and my hotfixes.

My development branch(Develop), will entail all the work done for the project.

My Release branch will help prepare the work in the development branch, to see if it is ready to release a new version in the main branch. It will also focus on any bugs found.

Hotfix branch will entail any rapid bug fixes that can be changed to allow it to merge with the main branch.

Main branch which will entail the final version of the project.

## gitignore File
For the gitignore file, I plan to ignore Visual Studio since it will be the IDE we will be using for the next 2 projects, Project 2 & 3.
This will ignore sensitive information that will be used, it will also ignore files that are not of any use. 

## Storage credentials and Sensitive information
To ensure that credentials and sensitive information is safely stored, I plan to utilise the resources provided by github. The licence and gitignore resouces are provided to ensure that no other user can change your work unless you provide permission for them to do that. Therefore the licences that will be used for my projects will be the MIT licence.
