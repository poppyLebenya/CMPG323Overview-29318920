## Branching Strategy
![alt text](https://github.com/poppyLebenya/CMPG323Overview-29318920/blob/GitFlow.png?raw=true)

With my branching stategy, I plan to have my main branch, development branch, release branch and my hotfixes.

My development branch(Develop), will entail all the work done for the project.

My Release branch will help prepare the work in the development branch, to see if it is ready to release a new version in the main branch. It will also focus on any bugs found.

Hotfix branch will entail any rapid bug fixes that can be changed to allow it to merge with the main branch.

Main branch which will entail the final version of the project.
